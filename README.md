# Description

myKilo is a simple text editor developed along side the [this tutorial](http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html), which is based on [antirezâ€™s kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108). Major thanks to [Jeremy Ruten](https://github.com/yjerem) for the time and effort spent in doing such a good job with this text, very well written and easy to understand. It's a good way to improve your C skills and learn a lot of new things you don't see on the everyday programming.
